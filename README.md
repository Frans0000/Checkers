# Checkers Game in C++ with SFML

This is my **first project** written in **C++**, where I challenged myself to build a full **checkers game** from scratch without using AI chats or much internet, which made the process a great learning experience. Thats why the code might be a bit chaotic and not optimized.

## Features

- **Classic Checkers Rules**: The game follows all the standard rules of checkers, including forced captures, multi captures forward and backwards, no backwards moves and so on.
- **1v1 Local Mode**: Play against a friend on the same device.
- **Bot Mode**: Play against a basic bot that makes random moves. Unfortunately, there is no machine learning in this version, so the bot's moves are not optimized or strategic.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core used to build the game.
- **SFML**: Used for rendering the graphics of the board and pawns.
- **Blender**: Used to create the boards and the pawns.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Compile the project in your C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Run the executable file and enjoy playing!
